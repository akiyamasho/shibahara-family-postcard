### Shibahara Family Postcard

Mehdi's baby Hana-chan has been born this week! 🎊 🎉

I'm planning to draw and paint a postcard and include everyone's messages/wishes.

I just use GitHub for fun (and free commits for everyone! lol)

_Plan_: I will send to him and archive this repo **by 2019/06/14 (Friday)**.

_To GitHub users_: Your message will be signed with your merge commit hash!

_To Non-GitHub users or people who want anonymity_: Just send me a message on Slack/LINE or wherever I shared the repo.

### How to Contribute

Simply make a PR and update `README.md` with the following format:

"\<message\>" - \<name\> (\<optional gitHub handle\>)

##### Example

- "Congratulations!" - John Doe (@johndoe59314134234)

### Current Postcard Progress

I don't have much free time this week, but I'll make sure to finish the post card before Friday!
